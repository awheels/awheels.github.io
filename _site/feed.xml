        <title>Organizing my Teaching with Google Sheets and Trello</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past several weeks I have been using a combination of Google Sheets and Trello for planning and organizing my teaching. It has been amazing! This is one of the first times that I have felt like I have a clear picture of where I am at on the giant list of things that I need to get done. So here is a breakdown of my three systems and how I’ve been using them. I’ve included links to the templates, so feel free to make copies for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;google-sheets-weekly-plan-shared-weekly-plan-templatehttpsdocsgooglecomspreadsheetsd1o2wxbbgyccmupcwobnu3lsmhxwxa2i1n2soxhvmfvfsedituspsharingtargetblank&quot;&gt;1. Google Sheets Weekly Plan &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1O2wXbBGYccMuPCwOBnu3LsmHXWXa2I1n2SoXHVMFVFs/edit?usp=sharing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Shared Weekly Plan Template)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to use a paper planner for organizing my weeks/months but this never worked well for me. When things changed and I had to scratch things out or draw giant arrows all over the place I ended up more stressed than before I started planning. This led to me trying Google Calendar. This definitely has it’s benefits but for me it just seemed to do too much and the base usage that I was looking for was lost in the excess functionality. For example, if I wanted to change some things around it often meant a lot of clicking and editing of times and descriptions. This is when I tried Google Sheets (not sure what took me so long!). I’ve created a simple weekly template that allows me to just jot down rough descriptions of what the plan is for each of my lessons. I’m able to jump from week to week very quickly and easily to see how my units will line up in the upcoming weeks. If things change it is a quick and easy fix. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/googlesheet-weekly-plan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;weeklyplan&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;google-sheets-unit-plans-shared-unit-plan-templatehttpsdocsgooglecomspreadsheetsd1fgheuxtr9iwhjaeuhycgw2xtvhoftvweczlhjksy8o4edituspsharingtargetblank&quot;&gt;2. Google Sheets Unit Plans &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fghEuxTr9iWhJAEUHyCgW2xTVhofTvwECZLHJKsy8o4/edit?usp=sharing&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;(Shared Unit Plan Template)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have a clear vision of what my coming weeks are going to look like it is time to lock down the specifics of my units. In the past I relied far too heavily on directories/folders on my computer. I honestly thought that this worked for me (I know better now!). I wanted the ability to quickly look at the bigger picture within my units, see how my lessons are lining up and be able to identify any gaps or issues. I also wanted something that was going to be reusable and easily shared. My units are far from perfect but to be able to continue to adapt and improve them I wanted something that was well documented and clear. This led to creating the template that you see below. It includes the title of the lesson, how many classes it will take, a description of what it will look like, the specific content/learning outcomes, links to all the resources used, and a section for extension material. All the linked resources are organized in my Google Drive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/googlesheet-unit-plan-9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;unitplan&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;trello&quot;&gt;3. Trello&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my best discovery! I have used Trello in the past for some mini projects but I never really stuck with using it. I found that the projects that I’d used it for were not quite big enough, so I never gave Trello a chance to really shine. But over the last six months I’ve taken on some bigger projects and I’ve been enjoying Trello for these. Then I thought, “Hey…maybe I can use Trello to help me with keeping track of those million and a half things that I need to get done as a teacher.” I’m only 3 weeks into using it for this purpose, but so far it has been brilliant! I’ve created a list for my Weekly Plans, Must Do Tasks, No Rush Tasks, In Progress, and Completed Tasks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;weekly-plans-list&quot;&gt;Weekly Plans List&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each card in Weekly Plans represents a week and within that card I have checklists for all the lessons that I need to have prepared for each of my courses (using Google Sheet Weekly Planner). Once I have the whole week of lessons planned (using my Google Sheets Unit Planner) I check them all off and move the card to the bottom of the list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;must-do-and-no-rush-lists&quot;&gt;Must Do and No Rush Lists&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Must Do and No Rush Tasks are exactly what they sound like - all those little and big things that get piled onto our plates as teachers. Whenever another item gets added to my list of things to do I just add it here. I’m then able to sit down and knock things off one by one whenever I have some extra time. Previously I had no tool for these types of things, I just tried to remember them (which had mixed results). This was probably the largest cause of stress for me because I always felt like I had so much to do but never had a clear picture of what all those things were. With Trello I can now sit down and see what I still have to do as well as see what I’ve already accomplished. I’m now also able to add cards for those things that I should be doing more of but just forget or avoid because I feel like there are other things that I need to get done first. For example, I’ve added a card for emailing parents with positive remarks regarding their child’s work in my math class. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h6 id=&quot;in-progress-list&quot;&gt;In Progress List&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some of those bigger items that I cannot quite finish all in one sitting. Or also for things that I’ve started the ball rolling on but still need to do further follow ups on before finishing off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/trello-planning.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;trelloplanning&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read this far! I hope you find some of the information that I have rambled on about useful. I’d love to hear any other tips or tricks that people use to help them with organizing and planning.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Python Across the Subjects Workshop</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This past weekend I ran an introductory coding workshop that was focused on helping teachers to see opportunities for the integration of coding (specifically Python) across various subject areas. Examples of possible student programming tasks that align with the science, mathematics, languages and art curriculums were discussed. Thanks to everyone who attended and to AISG for hosting a fantastic event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to contact me with any questions! I’m eager to collaborate and discuss coding and all the amazing ways that it can be integrated into our K-12 classrooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Teaching Binary</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;It is my feeling that many students are lacking in their fundamental number sense. To improve this it is important to show students the inner workings of the concepts they are learning. Ask a student to count to the number of students in their class and they will likely do so happily and confidently. Now tell them that they did a great job counting using the base 10 (or decimal) system, but how about they try counting using base 2 (or binary) system. They would likely give you a strange and puzzled look, and rightfully so. Why bother teaching them another system, as it’s not like they are going to use binary in their day to day life? Well, I believe that it is incredibly valuable to realize that the number system that we use in our day to day life is just one of many. Too much of math is thought to be some sort of magical system that we just take for granted. Also, understanding other systems will improve and help to add context to the base 10 system, thereby improving their day to day number sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;base-10-system-decimal&quot;&gt;Base 10 System (Decimal)&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the age of your students you might get some ‘I know this’ stares when you start talking about the decimal system. But again, I think we are so used to this system that we take some things for granted. I like to ask the students questions like “Why do you think we call it the decimal system?” and “Why is it also referred to base 10, specifically why 10?”. If they give you some blank stares I generally follow up with “What is a decade? How about a decathalon?” and this usually leads to a “Hey it is something to do with 10!”. Great, but why 10? Well how many digits do we have in our counting system? Again, this might seem obvious but many students will count from 1-9 and then continue on to 10, 11, 12 and on. This is where I focus on the term ‘digit’. And within a few minutes, we have identified that it is base 10 because there are 10 digits. We then continue on from here, possibly using a table similar to the one shown below, and start to apply the decimal system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20150914_img3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;baseten&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;base-2-system-binary&quot;&gt;Base 2 System (Binary)&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where the foundation set by the review of the decimal system should pay off. Questions such as, “Why do they call it the binary system?” and “Why base 2?” should give some relatively quick answers. A bicycle has two wheels and we are called bipeds because we have two legs, so good chance that the number 2 has something to do with why it is called binary. So the magic number was 10 for the decimal system and it was because there was 10 digits, therefore it would make sense if the binary system had two digits. Except, we don’t call them digits, that is only for the decimal system. With the binary system we call them bits, so the binary system has 2 bits in the exact same way as the decimal system has 10 digits. Now as you continue to build up and connect the students understanding of the decimal system to the new (but similar) binary system, you should be able to construct a table similar to the one below. With this table, students should be able to relatively easily convert decimal values into binary ones. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20150914_img2.png&quot; alt=&quot;basetwo&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;so-computers-use-binary-prove-it&quot;&gt;So computer’s use binary? Prove it!&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so the kids know about binary now…big deal. And at this point I would agree because it is with context that things become interesting. Talking about how computers only understand binary, so all your of programs that you write are converted into binary using a compiler is pretty cool. But again, it adds very little context and they are just left with accepting it is a fact that is being told to them. So what does a teacher do when presented with the difficult teaching situation? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/psys-gangnam-style-breaks-the-internet-20141204-11zusj.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Resort to music videos on YouTube!&lt;/a&gt; Everyone knows Gangnam Style and some of your students might also be aware of the fact that it was responsible for breaking YouTube. But now they actually have the knowledge and understanding to grasp exactly how that happened. It is also a great piece of evidence to show that computer use binary, because if YouTube uses it then it must be true.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My love affair with the fuji x100t</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have loved photography for a long time and the DSLR was my tried and true camera. But the Fuji x100t is starting to pull me away from the world of the DSLR and I credit it with reigniting my passion. In this post I am going to give a little run down of why I love the x100t. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;light-and-compact&quot;&gt;1. Light and Compact&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pros of the DSLR are vast; unfortunately one of its pros is definitely not being light and compact. Over the course of my photography journey I slowly began to bring my DSLR along with me less and less. If I was photographing a family session or a wedding my DSLR came with me, but otherwise I settled for my iphone. It is sad, I know! But unless I was going out with the specific task of taking photographs, I left my DSLR at home. This is not the case with the x100t. Going for a hike? I bring it. Grabbing some sushi? I bring it. Walking to the grocery store? I bring it. The camera is so light and compact that I happily carry it around basically anywhere I go. What this means is that I can capture those images that grab you during day to day life, which are often the most valuable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20150912_img6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;dog&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;beautiful-jpegs&quot;&gt;2. Beautiful JPEGs&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was one of those people that shot RAW images 99% of the time. I was never quite happy with the way that my DSLR rendered JPEGs straight out of the camera. With the x100t I’ve switched to shooting 99% JPEGs, in large part thanks to the beautiful way that Fuji renders their JPEGs. If you provide the x100t with great light it in turn provides you with mind blowingly beautiful JPEGs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20150912_img2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;portrait&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;wifi&quot;&gt;3. Wifi&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know those features that you think you’ll never use but they end up being one of your favourites? Well built-in wifi is one of those features for me. Thanks to the x100t’s beautiful JPEGs and light and compact size I am able to move photographs directly from the camera to my iphone or ipad and do some quick and light processing using VSCO on the fly. The old me with my DSLR would take photographs and then come home and eventually get around to importing the RAW files onto my computer, processing them, converting them to JPEGs and then maybe sharing them. With the way that life gets in the way, this entire process would easily take days, if not weeks. On that note, I think I have a collection of RAW images from my trip to Costa Rica from 2 years ago that are still waiting to be dealt with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20150912_img3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;beach&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;manual-controls&quot;&gt;4. Manual Controls&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love photography not only for its creative and artistic side, but also for how its precise and scientific nature. So the fact that the x100t has full manual controls, that are quick and intuitive is obviously another of the reasons that I am in love with it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20150912_img4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;river&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;it-is-a-beautiful-camera&quot;&gt;5. It is a beautiful camera!&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above four items combine to create an amazing camera. It is literally changing the way I photograph and I know that it is going to help me evolve into a stronger photographer, both creatively and technically. Of course the looks of a camera play no part in the images that it creates, but having a beautiful looking camera sure is nice. Well, the Fuji x100t is exactly that, a straight up BEAUTIFUL camera. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/20150912_img7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;best-friends&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are just a handful of the reasons that I love the Fuji x100t. I could go on about the electronic viewfinder, its film simulations, and its beautiful 23mm fixed lens. But what I love about the x100t is not so much for all its technically prowess (which is does have), I love it for the way it gets out of the way and just lets me capture great images. I’m excited to continue my x100t love affair and see where it takes me!&lt;/p&gt;
