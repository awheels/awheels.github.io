    title: Coding
    desc:
      Eager to learn to code, I completed a coding program through Lighthouse Labs in September 2014. I have continued to learn and develop my skills while working as a junior developer at several tech start-up companies. In my free time I am using my newly acquired skills to work on personal projects that incorporate my passions for education and photography.

    title: Photography
    desc:
      While teaching abroad I discovered an interest for photography. This interest developed rather quickly into a passion. I have since gained experiences with my own personal photography business where I photographed weddings and families. I am currently very interested in landscape and street photography, along with a curiosity for film.

    <p>Everyone needs a passion. They bring vibrance and purpose to one's life while fostering an appreciation for life-long learning. I've been fortunate to discover my passion for education, coding, and photography. Of course, the more passions the better and for that reason I'm always eager to add new interests to the list. I also have a strong affinity for four-legged furry friends, good boardgame nights, and deliciously brewed coffee.</p>
