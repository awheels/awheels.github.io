excerpt:
  I'm going to be applying for the upcoming Google Innovators Program. My proposed project obviously deals with coding education. To help me show others the positives of learning to code I decided to code a simple game that identifies some of the reasons I think kids should at least be exposed to basic coding. My game is appropriately called "Why learn coding?".

I'm going to be applying for the upcoming Google Innovators Program. My proposed project obviously deals with coding education, so I thought that it made sense to actually code something for my application. To help me show others the positives of learning to code, I decided to code a simple game that identifies some of the reasons I think kids should at least be exposed to basic coding. My game is appropriately called "Why learn coding?". Although, it does not keep score or time so I guess it is more of an activity than a game.<br><br>
