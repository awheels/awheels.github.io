excerpt:
  This past weekend I ran an introductory coding workshop that was focused on helping teachers to see opportunities for the integration of coding (specifically Python) across various subject areas. Examples of possible student programming tasks that align with the science, mathematics, languages and art curriculums were discussed. Thanks to everyone who attended and to AISG for hosting a fantastic event.

Please feel free to contact me with any questions! I'm eager to collaborate and discuss coding and all the amazing ways that it can be integrated into our K-12 classrooms.<br><br>
