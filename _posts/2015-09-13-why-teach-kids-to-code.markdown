excerpt:
  Teaching kids to code seems to be one of the next 'big things' in education. With that, there are tonnes of different viewpoints on why this should be something that we are teaching kids. In this post I will give my opinion  on some of the common arguments, as well as provide thoughts on why kids should learn to code.

<!-- 1. Great practice for precise, disciplined, and abstract thinking
Precise - a program either works or it does not
Disciplined – being methodical and embracing routine while also practicing regular critical reflection
Abstract – taking real world problem and solving it creatively with your code

2. Converts you from a digital consumer to a digital producer
Computers are either appliances or tools 
With even a basic understanding of coding you can start to use computers as a tool to help you accomplish tasks

3. Great practice for continued learning
Google is a programmer’s best friend 
You will have questions and you will need to find the answers to these questions 
Learning which keywords to use, filtering out useless advice from good advice and asking clear questions are all important skills that you will develop
