      <h3>ISZAF Art Challenge</h3>
      <p>
        I've been keen to experiment more with Processing, so when I heard about an art challenge being organized by the International Shenzhen Artist Forum (ISZAF), I was eager to participate. I do not identify as an expert coder nor an artist, but they are both areas that I was looking to grow in and further explore. The challenge consists of three phases. My works for each of these phases can be found on the blog posts below. You can also find my code <a href="https://github.com/awheels/ISZAF-Art-Challenge" target="_blank">here</a>.
