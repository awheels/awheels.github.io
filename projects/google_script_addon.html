      <h3>Google Sheets Add-On for Teacher Planning</h3>
      <p>
        I've been using Google Sheets for almost all of my planning for over a year now. However, I was getting tired of copying and pasting templates and updating dates based on my schools 8 day cycle. What started as a quick Google Script hack to simplify my workflow has now grown into a slightly bigger project. I'm working on creating a Google Script Add-On for Google Sheets that will allow anyone to generate a planning timetable for any number of periods and various types of school cycles. After it is finished I hoping to connect it to Google Calendar so that teachers can sync their planning doc with their calendar. Feel free to checkout the Github Repository for the script below!
