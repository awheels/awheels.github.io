      <h3>Fundraising Photography Project</h3>
      <p>
        I started a photography project at my previous school that went on to fundraise ~40k dollars over three years. Over the course of a week I took individual portraits of each student and merged them together into unique and creative class photos. These were then auctioned off at a yearly school fundraising event.
