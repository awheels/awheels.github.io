      <h3>Family and Wedding Photography</h3>
      <p>
        My passion for photography led me to start a wedding and family photography business. I am currently stepping away from my business, as I want to focus more on personal photography projects. I am grateful for all the learning opportunities that my experiences with wedding and family photography has provided me, as they will be invaluable as I move to other areas of photography.
